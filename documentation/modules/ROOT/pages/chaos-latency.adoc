= Chaos Experiment 1: Injecting latencies

_XX MINUTE PRACTICE_

In production, it is very common to have delay services rather than down services.

_How does **Travels Service** behave when one of its dependant services experiment network latencies?_

== Add Latency

In the {KIALI_URL}[Kiali Console^], from the **'Graph' view**, `*right-click on the 'Hotels' service and select 'Details'*`

image::kiali-right-click-hotel-service.png[Kiali - Right Click Service,400]

You will be redirected to the Service Details page. 

`*Click on the 'Actions' > 'Fault Injection'*`

`*Add HTTP Delay by entering the following settings:*`

.HTTP Delay Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Add HTTP Delay 
|**Enabled**
|

|Delay Percentage
|**30**
|

|Fixed Delayed
|**1s**
|

|===

`*Click on the 'Create' button*`. 

**30% of the traffic of the 'Hotels' service has now 1 second of delay.** Now let's see the impact of the application.

In the {GRAFANA_URL}[Chaos Engineering Dashboard], you can see the result of the chaos experiment.
First, `*select the following variables on the dashboard*`:

.Dashboard Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Namespace 
|**chaos-engineering{USER_ID}**
|

|Service
|**travels**
|

|===

From the **'Service Overview'** or **'Request Duration'** panels, you can tell that the "Travels" service is particularly impacted when there is a network latency with one of its dependant services.

== Chaos Experiment 1: Solving detected issues

To minimize the latency impact, you can use the **timeout pattern** which is probably the most common resilience pattern for distributed systems.
The goal is to fail a request after a certain period of time to avoid code and resources locking when the service is waiting for a response that takes too long or that might never arrive.

In the {KIALI_URL}[Kiali Console^], from the **'Services' view**, `*click on the 'travels' > 'Actions' > 'Request Timeouts'*`

image::kiali-request-timeout-actions.png[Kiali - Request Timeout Actions,900]

`*Add HTTP Timeout by entering the following settings:*`

.HTTP Timeout Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Add HTTP Timeout 
|**Enabled**
|

|Timeout
|**50ms**
|

|===

image::kiali-configure-timeout.png[Kiali - Configure Timeout,400]

In {GRAFANA_URL}[Grafana^], from the **Chaos Engineering Dashboard**, `*scroll down and see the latency metrics*`

After a while, you can see the impact of our configuration. Indeed, the latency on **Travels** service has reduced and
the latency metrics become green again.

image::grafana-timeout-details-1.png[Grafana - Timeout Details,900]

image::grafana-timeout-details-2.png[Grafana - Timeout Details,900]

The latency issues have been fixed but the timeout pattern introduces errors for the requests which exceeds the threshold.
`*Scroll up and see the error rate metrics*`

== TODO

You have implemented timeouts for the travels service. 
Let's implementing a strategy of retry to mitigate these transient errors.

In the {KIALI_URL}[Kiali Console^], from the **'Services' view**, 
`*click on the 'travels' > 'Actions' > 'Request Timeouts' and add HTTP Retry by entering the following settings:*`

.HTTP Retry Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Add HTTP Retry 
|**Enabled**
|

|Attempts
|**3**
|

|Per Try Timeout
|**10ms**
|

|===

image::kiali-configure-retry.png[Kiali - Configure Retry,400]

`*Back to {GRAFANA_URL}[Grafana^]*`, you can tell the retry pattern reduces the error rates without impacting the latency.
