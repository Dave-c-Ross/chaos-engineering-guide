= Chaos Experiment 1: Network latency

_XX MINUTE PRACTICE_

In production, it is very common to have delay services rather than down services. **Latency** measures the delay between an action and a response. For this first experiment, we will test the following hypothesis:

_**A small network latency should not impact the Service Level Objective (SLO) of the Travel Service**_

== Define the steady state


In the {GRAFANA_URL}[Chaos Engineering Dashboard, role='params-link'], you can analyze the different metrics and define the Steady State for our chaos experiment.
First, `*select the following variables on the dashboard*`:

.Dashboard Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Namespace 
|**chaos-engineering{USER_ID}**
|

|Service
|**travels.chaos-engineering{USER_ID}.svc.cluster.local**
|

|===

From the **Namespace section**, you can tell that **99% of requests are successful and served within 50 ms**  

image::grafana-steady-state-latency.png[Grafana - Steady State Latency,900]

So we will define this SLO as "steady-state".

`*Click on 'Service Overview' > Edit*`

Then, `*click on 'Visualization Settings' icon on the left hand sidebar, scroll down to find the 'P99 Latency (Value #D)' rule and enter the following information for Thresholds*`

.P99 Latency Thresholds Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Thresholds 
|**50,100**
|

|Color Mode
|**Cell**
|

|Colors
|**Green/Yellow/Red** (click on the 'invert' button if needed)
|

|===

`*Scroll down again and to find the 'Success Rate (Value #E)' rule and enter the following information for Thresholds*`

.Success Rate Thresholds Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Thresholds 
|**0.95,0.99**
|

|Color Mode
|**Cell**
|

|Colors
|**Red/Yellow/Green** (click on the 'invert' button if needed)
|

|===

image::grafana-success-rate-threholds.png[Grafana - Sucess Rate Threholds,700]

Once done, you should have the following outcome (all green).

`*Click on the 'Disk' icon to save and go back to the Dashboard.*`

== Run the Chaos experiment

In the {KIALI_URL}[Kiali Console^, role='params-link'], from the **'Graph' view**, `*right-click on the 'discounts' service and select 'Details'*`

image::kiali-right-click-service.png[Kiali - Right Click Service,400]

You will be redirected to the Service Details page. 

`*Click on the 'Actions' > 'Fault Injection'*`

`*Add HTTP Delay by entering the following settings:*`

.HTTP Delay Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Add HTTP Delay 
|**Enabled**
|

|Delay Percentage
|**30**
|

|Fixed Delayed
|**1s**
|

|===

image::kiali-configure-latency.png[Kiali - Configure Latency,300]

`*Click on the 'Create' button*`. 

**30% of the traffic of the 'discounts' service has now 1 second of delay.** Now let's see the impact of the application.

== Analyze the Chaos outcome

In the {GRAFANA_URL}[Chaos Engineering Dashboard], you can see the result of the chaos experiment.

image::kiali-latency-fault-overview.png[Kiali - Latency Fault Overview,900]

From the **'Service Overview'** or **'Request Duration'** panels, you can tell the following about the small network latency based on our hypothesis:

- there is no impact on the Success Rate of the overall requests (100%)
- there is a huge impact on the performance of the application. 

Indeed, just 1 second of delay on 30% of the traffic of one dependant service induces **a latency propagation of more than 2 seconds across the system**.

image::kiali-latency-fault-details.png[Kiali - Latency Fault Details,900]

In conclusion, you can tell the **application is not resilient to a small network latency**. To reduce or fix this phenomenon, you could configure the autoscaling or implement a cache mechanism across the different services of the applications.


== Rollback the Chaos experiment

In the {KIALI_URL}[Kiali Console^, role='params-link'], from the **'Graph' view**, `*right-click on the 'discounts' service and select 'Details'*`

image::kiali-right-click-service.png[Kiali - Right Click Service,400]

You will be redirected to the Service Details page. 

`*Click on the 'Actions' > 'Fault Injection'*`

`*Disable HTTP Delay by entering the following settings:*`

.HTTP Delay Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Add HTTP Delay 
|**Disabled**

`*Click on the 'Update' button*`.
