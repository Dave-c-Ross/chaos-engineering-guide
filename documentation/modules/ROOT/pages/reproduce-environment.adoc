https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/[Argo CD^] is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

It follows the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining 
the desired application state. 

It automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. Application 
deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit.

=== Log in to Argo CD

`*Click on the below button called 'Developer GitOps'*`

Then `*login as user{{USER_ID}}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }}*`, `*click on 'Allow selected permissions'*`

Once completed, you will be redirected to the following page.

=== Sync/Deploy The GitOps Application

Let's deploy the Coolstore Application into cn-project{{USER_ID}}!

From the **Application menu**, `*Click on 'Sync > Synchronize'*`.

This task retrieves the manifests from the GitOps Repository and performs _kubectl apply_ command of 
the manifests. Your application is now running and you can now view its resource components, 
logs, events, and assessed health status.

`*Click on your 'coolstore' application*` and you should see everything in green.

In the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*Select the 'cn-project{{USER_ID}}'*` to be taken to the project overview page.

image:{% image_path openshift-app-deployed-by-argocd.png %}[OpenShift - Coolstore Project Deployed by Argo CD , 700]

You can see that all resources of your application have been created by Argo CD. 
None of the services is deployed, up and running as we removed all automatic deployment triggers when exporting the configuration
and there is no image available on your **cn-project{{USER_ID}}** project. **You are going to fix it in the next lab.**
